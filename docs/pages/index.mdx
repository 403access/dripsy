# Dripsy

A **dead-simple**, **responsive** design system for Expo / React Native Web. It's inspired by React's [`theme-ui`](https://theme-ui.com/).

**Style once, run anywhere.**

```jsx
<Text
  sx={{
    fontSize: [14, 16, 20], // 14 on mobile, 16 on tablet, 20 on desktop
    color: ['primary', null, 'accent'], // `primary` on mobile & tablet, `accent` on desktop
  }}
>
  Responsive font size?? ðŸ¤¯
</Text>
```
