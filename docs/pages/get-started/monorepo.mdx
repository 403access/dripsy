# Starter Project

I recommend using [this monorepo starter](https://solito.dev/starter) from Solito. It comes pre-installed with Dripsy, and it also has a Next.js entrypoint. It's a good starting point for React Native + Next.js. 

If you haven't heard of [Solito](https://solito.dev) â€“ it's a library I built that helps you pair React Native with Next.js's navigation.

## With the terminal

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example dripsy-starter
```

Then `cd` into it:

```bash
cd dripsy-starter
```

### Change the remote

Next, create a new repo on GitHub, copy the URL (which should end in `.git`), and point the remote there:

```bash
git remote set-url origin <remote_url>
```

For instance:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy-example.git
```
