# Starter Project

I recommend using [this monorepo starter](https://solito.dev/starter) from Solito. It comes pre-installed with Dripsy, and it also has a Next.js entrypoint. It's a good starting point for React Native + Next.js. 

If you haven't heard of [Solito](https://solito.dev) â€“ it's a library I built that helps you pair React Native with Next.js's navigation.

```bash
npx create-solito-app@latest my-dripsy-app
```
