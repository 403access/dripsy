# Use Dripsy with Next.js

Once you've already completed the installation steps for `dripsy` & wrapped your app with `DripsyProvider`, you can do the final simple steps to get it ready for your Next.js app.

## Recommendation: use the monorepo starter

I recommend using Expo's Next.js integration. The best way to do so is with a monorepo.

If you can, [use the monorepo starter](/get-started/monorepo). It will make your life a lot easier.

Next.js 11 works best with React Native if it has separate entrypoints, so a monorepo makes this work.

Also, both Expo and Vercel support monorepos.

## Alternate: install yourself

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn add -D next-compose-plugins next-transpile-modules @expo/next-adapter
```

**2. Edit your `next.config.js` file to look something like this:**

```js
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')([
  'dripsy',

  // you can add other packages here that need transpiling
])

const { withExpo } = require('@expo/next-adapter')

module.exports = withPlugins(
  [withTM],
  withExpo({
    projectRoot: __dirname,
  })
)
```

**3. Set `ssr={true}` on `DripsyProvider`**

```js
// pages/_app.js

export default function App({ pageProps, Component }) {
  return (
    <>
      <DripsyProvider
        ssr
        ssrPlaceholder={<LoadingScreen />} // optional
        theme={theme}
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </DripsyProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

What does `ssr: true` do, exactly? All it does is return `null` until your app is mounted (on web). This is because Dripsy uses the `Dimensions` API from `react-native`, which isn't compatible with server-side rendering.

If your app already returns `null` on the first render, then you don't need to set `ssr: true`. For instance, using `react-native-safe-area-context`'s `SafeAreaProvider` already does this for you.

## SEO

If you're curious how you can still leverage Next.js's great static generation feature for SEO with dynamic meta tags, check out the [**SEO Recommendations**](/get-started/web/seo).
