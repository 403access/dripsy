# Strict Variants

Dripsy has a `variant` and `variants` prop on every component.

Once you've configured your TypeScript setup, these props will get autocomplete.

## `theme.types.strictVariants`

Dripsy lets you customize how strict the types are for your variant props.

```ts
makeTheme({
  types: {
    strictVariants: true, // default
  },
})
```

## How it works

By default, components can use the variant that matches their variant keys.

For example, a `<Text />` component can use variants defined by `theme.text`, and TypeScript will error otherwise.

For components that don't have a `themeKey` defined, such as `View`, you can use any nested variant from your theme.

<img src="/view-variant.png" />

## Disable strict variants

```tsx
makeTheme({
  types: {
    strictVariants: false, // defaults to true
  },
})
```

If you set `theme.types.strictVariants` to `false`, then any component, including those _with_ a `themeKey`, can use nested variants.

For example, with disabled `strictVariants` the `<Text />` component can now use variants other than those in `theme.text`.

You probably shouldn't use this. Strict variants are better.

## Variants for custom components.

Using the [`styled`](/apis/styled#advanced-usage) function from Dripsy, you can apply variants to custom components.

```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native'

import { styled } from 'dripsy'
import { View } from 'react-native'

const MyContainer = styled(View, {
  themeKey: 'layout',
})()
```

Now, you can use variants from `theme.layout` on `MyContainer`.

```tsx
const theme = makeTheme({
  layout: {
    wide: {
      maxWidth: 1100
    }
  }
})

// in your component
<MyContainer variant="wide" />
```
