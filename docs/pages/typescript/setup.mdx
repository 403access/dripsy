# Setup TypeScript

Call the [`makeTheme`](/apis/makeTheme) function, add declaration merging, and you get amazing intellisense and TypeScript support.

```jsx
import { makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  // your theme
})

type MyTheme = typeof theme

declare module 'dripsy' {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
  interface DripsyCustomTheme extends MyTheme {}
}
```

## Gotchas

If you don't see autocomplete, there could be a few reasons.

1. **You need to restart VSCode** (yeah, really)
2. You need at least TypeScript 4.4+: `yarn add -D typescript`

## You're ready!

You now have awesome TypeScript intellisense for your theme, throughout your app.
