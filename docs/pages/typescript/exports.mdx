# TypeScript Exports

You can import a few useful types:

- `Sx`
- `SxProp` (Same as `Sx`, except that it also allows a factory function)
- `Theme` which is the type for your theme. This will match your custom theme if you completed the TypeScript Guide.

```tsx
import type { Sx, SxProp, Theme } from 'dripsy'
```
