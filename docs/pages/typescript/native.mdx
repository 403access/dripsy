# Enforce React Native types

If you set `reactNativeTypesOnly` to `true`, then you can only pass styles that fit a React Native style object.

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  types: {
    reactNativeTypesOnly: true,
  },
})
```

## Breakdown

On web, you can set `fontWeight` as a number, like so: `fontWeight: 400`.

With React Native, on the other hand, font weights must be strings (`fontWeight: '400'`).

> Using a number would probably work with Dripsy if you've utilized the `customFonts` feature in your theme.

## Recommendation

I recommend setting `theme.types.reactNativeTypesOnly` to `true`. It is safer.

It defaults to `false` to avoid breaking changes with users who are on v2 who don't want to refactor.

If your app is new to Dripsy, you should set this field to `true`.

And it may work to set it to `true` in your existing app too. If it riddles your type checker with errors, then you can easily disable it.

## Web-only types

To clarify: when this is `false`, it will allow either theme-ui types for a given field, _or_ React Native types.

When it's set to `true`, it will _only_ allow React Native types (as long as they exist.)

For example: React Native has no `cursor` property, so using this field will always pull from Web-compatible types.
