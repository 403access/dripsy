# Upgrade to Dripsy v3

This version is a really exciting advance in the developer experience of Dripsy.

```bash
yarn add dripsy
```

Once you read about the new features, check out the [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide).

While there are no breaking changes, there are many cool features to take advantage of (and it will only take a minute).

## Features / Improvements 🥸

### DX 👨🏽‍💻

- [x] Add intellisense for `useDripsyTheme`
- [x] Add intellisense for `sx` prop
- [x] Add intellisense for `gradient` and `colors` on `@dripsy/gradient`
- [x] Add intellisense for `useResponsiveValue(theme => [theme.colors.background])`
- [x] Add intellisense for `useSx`
- [x] Add intellisense for `sx` factory (`sx={theme => ({ color: theme.colors.text })}`
- [x] Add `makeTheme` function to override default one with a custom theme
- [x] Allow module declaration for merging TypeScript theme
- [x] Remove `@theme-ui/core`
- [x] Remove all Theme UI runtime code
- [x] Use `@theme-ui/css` for types only
- [x] Move `DripsyProvider` to use internal Dripsy context rather than Theme UI (BREAKING if you use the `jsx` pragma in your app)
- [x] Add intellisense for `styled` and `makeThemedComponent`
- [x] Add intellisense for `themeKey` in `styled`
- [x] Add intellisense for `variant` and `variants`
- [x] Make intellisense for `variant` only pick based on the specified `themeKey`
- [x] Add scale-specific theme tokens. For instance, `backgroundColor` should only get tokens from the `theme.colors`. (Is this blocking? It could take a lot of effort. Not sure if it should be blocking)
- [x] Allow arrays in the theme (is this blocking?)
- [x] Map theme UI styles onto RN styles if the key exists (width can be a string on web, but not native, unless it's from the theme). Maybe we just add in all RN style options here.
- [x] Add option to enforce strict types from RN styles mapped with theme (`padding` can be `$1` from the theme and `1`, but not `"1"` if that's not in the theme)
- [x] Log error from Dripsy if you pass `""` as a style?
- [x] Ensure that `Tokenize` is performant for large themes
- [x] Test in large monorepo

### Performance 🦦

- [x] Memoize `sx` prop under the hood
- [x] Improve `Gradient` memoization

### Features 🛩

- [x] Add support for `Pressable`'s factory `style={interaction => ({ ... })}` prop
- [x] Add `textShadows` to theme
- [x] Add `shadows` to theme with RN style
- [x] Add `transform` to `sx` prop
- [x] Add `boxShadow` to `sx` prop with intellisense
- [x] Add `textShadow` to `sx` prop with intellisense
- [x] Suport React Native 0.65

## Upgrade Guide

Dripsy v3 is now available. The upgrade from v2 should take about 1 minute.

### Install v3

```bash
yarn add dripsy

## if you use this package, upgrade it too
yarn add @dripsy/gradient
```

### Versions

Make sure you have at least TypeScript 4.4+:

```bash
yarn add -D typescript
```

### Add `makeTheme`

All you have to do to upgrade is wrap your `theme` with `makeTheme`, and then use module declaration.

```js
import { makeTheme } from 'dripsy'

const theme = makeTheme({
  colors: { primary: 'blue' },
})

type MyTheme = typeof theme

declare module 'dripsy' {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
  interface DripsyCustomTheme extends MyTheme {}
}
```

You now get intellisense 🥳

## Gotchas

If you don't see autocomplete, there could be a few reasons.

1. **You need to restart VSCode** (yeah, really)
2. You might have an old version of TypeScript (you should use 4.4+). `yarn add -D typescript`

## Strict Types

If you want to enforce strict types for your `sx` prop, you can do so with the new `theme.types` field:

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  // ...your theme here
  types: {
    onlyAllowThemeValues: 'always', // default: 'never'
  },
})
```

By setting `types.onlyAllowThemeValues` to `always`, you restrict yourself to only using theme values in your `sx` prop. While this may feel like overkill, it is a good pattern of enforcing consistent design.

This will only apply to theme values that are set. For example, if you haven't set the `theme.space` property, then strict types won't enforce for `padding`, `margin`, etc.

### Incremental strict types

It's possible you want to implement strict types on a per-scale basis. The `types.onlyAllowThemeValues` also accepts an object with per-scale definitions.

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  space: {
    $0: 0,
    $1: 4,
    $2: 8,
    $3: 16,
    $4: 32,
    $5: 64,
    $6: 128,
    $7: 256,
    $8: 512,
  },
  types: {
    onlyAllowThemeValues: {
      space: 'always',
    },
  },
})
```

Now, our `sx` prop's space-related properties (such as margin, padding, etc) will only accept one of the values in `theme.space`. To take full advantage of this feature, it is recommended that you don't use arrays, and instead make a dictionary with `$` prefixes, such as the `space` one above.

### Recommendation

The strict types feature is especially useful if you want to upgrade to Dripsy 3, have no breaking changes with your types, but slowly transition your app to have stricter types.

It also makes changing your theme **much** easier. For example, imagine that you change your `space` from an array to a dictionary:

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  // before
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],
  // after
  space: {
    $0: 0,
    $1: 4,
    $2: 8,
    $3: 16,
    $4: 32,
    $5: 64,
    $6: 128,
    $7: 256,
    $8: 512,
  },
})
```

After changing your `theme.space`, you likely have hundreds of invalid styles throughout your app. Finding them all would be a mess.

However, with incremental strict types, you could achieve this code refactor in seconds.

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  // before
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],
  // after
  space: {
    $0: 0,
    $1: 4,
    $2: 8,
    $3: 16,
    $4: 32,
    $5: 64,
    $6: 128,
    $7: 256,
    $8: 512,
  },
  types: {
    onlyAllowThemeValues: {
      space: 'always',
    },
  },
})
```

Now, simply run your TypeScript type-checker (`yarn tsc --noEmit`) to see all the places you need to update. You'll get useful errors like this:

/>

> If you want an escape hatch that lets you style without theme keys without disabling strict types, use the `style` prop instead of `sx`.

### Enforce React Native types

default: `false`

```js
const theme = makeTheme({
  // ... theme
  types: {
    reactNativeTypesOnly: true, // default false
  },
})
```

If you set this field to `true`, then you can only pass styles that fit a React Native style object.

For example, on web, you can set `fontWeight` as a number, like so: `fontWeight: 400`. With React Native, font weights must be strings (`fontWeight: '400'`). Using a number here would probably work with dripsy if you've utilized the `customFonts` feature in your theme.

I recommend setting this field to `true`. However, it will default to `false` to avoid breaking changes with users who are on v2 (like me) who don't want to refactor everywhere. If your app is just adding Dripsy, you should set this field to `true`. And it may work to set it to `true` either way. If it riddles your type checker with errors, then you can easily disable it.

To clarify: when this is `false`, it will allow either theme-ui types for a given field, _or_ React Native types. When it's set to `true`, it will _only_ allow React Native types (if they exist.)

Since React Native has no `cursor` property, for instance, using this field will always pull from the theme-ui web types.

## Breaking Changes

There are essentially no breaking changes.

If you are a very advanced user with a custom setup, this might be breaking for you:

- Removed `@theme-ui/core` dependency

  - For 99% of people, this won't matter. You likely didn't even know about this dependency. If that's the case, ignore this.
  - However, if you were using a very custom (undocumented) Dripsy setup with `theme-ui` on web, you'll need to wrap your app with `theme-ui`'s `ThemeProvider` yourself. Previously, Dripsy used that provider under the hood.

- Removed `Button` component (just import it from `react-native` instead of `dripsy`)

### Array values

~~If your theme had any array values, turn them into objects.~~

Arrays in theme were [added](https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy/pull/124#:~:text=array%20intellisense%20support-,ce87637,-Merge%20state) to `v3`.
